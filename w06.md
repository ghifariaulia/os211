# Top 10 List of Week 06

1. [Concurrency](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/concurrency-in-operating-system/)<br>
Concurrency is the execution of the multiple instruction sequences at the same time. This site explains principles of concurrency, problems in concurrency, advantages of concurrency, drawbacks of concurrency, and issues of concurrency.

2. [What is a Race Condition?](https://www.baeldung.com/cs/race-conditions)<br>
Race condition is a condition of a program where its behavior depends on relative timing or interleaving of multiple threads or processes. Race condition is one of the common problems in multithreaded applications. This site has a way to detect race condition and how to handle them.

3. [Blocking](http://faculty.salina.k-state.edu/tim/ossg/Device/blocking.html)<br>
In computing, a process is an instance of a computer program that is being executed. A 
process always exists in exactly one process state. A process that is **blocked** is 
one that is waiting for some event, such as a resource becoming available or the 
completion of an I/O operation. This site has illustration the difference about blocking I/O system calls and Nonblocking I/O system calls.

4. [Deadlock](https://www.guru99.com/deadlock-in-operating-system.html)<br>
Deadlock is a situation that occurs in OS when any process enters a waiting state because another waiting process is holding the demanded resource.

5. [Starvation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/starvation-and-aging-in-operating-systems/)<br>
Starvation is phenomenon associated with the Priority scheduling algorithms, in which a process ready to run for CPU can wait indefinitely because of low priority. The difference of Starvation and Deadlock is explained here and also the solution to starvation is explained too.

6. [Thread](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/thread-in-operating-system/)<br>
Thread is a path of execution within a process. A process can contain multiple threads.
This site explains what are the advantages of thread over process and the differences of thread and process.

7. [Multithreading](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_multi_threading.htm)<br>
This site explains what is multithreading. It explains each of the multithreading models such as Many to Many Model, Many to One Model, and One to One Model.

8. [Process Scheduler](https://www.javatpoint.com/os-process-schedulers)<br>
Operating system uses various schedulers for the process scheduling. OS usually uses 3 scheduler such as Long Term Scheduler, Short Term Scheduler, and Medium Term Scheduler.
This site explains the differences of the schedulers and how it works.

9. [Linux Process Management](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix/unix-processes.htm)<br>
In linux there are Foreground Process and Background Process. By default every process that you start runs in the foreground. A background process runs without being connected to your keyboard if the background process requires any keyboard input it waits. Each process in the system has a unique PID or Process ID. This site explains what is Foreground Processes, Background Processes, Parent and Child Processes, and Daemon Processes.

10. [Process States](https://www.javatpoint.com/os-process-states)<br>
This site explains process states from its creation to completion. The minimum number of states required is five. It also explaings the operations on the process such as Creation, Scheduling, Execution, and Deletion.
