# Top 10 List of Week 03

1.[What is a Tarball?](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/t/tarball.htm)<br>
 **Tarball** is name of an archive of files that are bundled together using the tar command. The term **tar** is short for tape archive.

2.[Linux File Systems Explained](https://www.tecmint.com/linux-file-system-explained/)<br>
Standard linux file systems includes ext4, ext3, ext2, jfs, ReiserFS, XFS, and Btrfs. Right now ext4 is the preferred and most widely
used Linux file system. In certain special cases XFS and ReiserFS are used. Btrfs is still used in experimental environment. JFS is an
alternative to ext4 currently and is used when stability is required with the use of very few resources.

3.[How to Create ext2, ext3, ext4 and How to convert it](https://www.tecmint.com/what-is-ext2-ext3-ext4-and-how-to-create-and-convert-linux-file-systems/)<br>
We can use **mke2fs** command to create either of the file systems. For example : to create an ext2 file system 
"mke2fs /dev/hdXX" replace XX with your own device name. To convert the file system we can use **tune2fs** command.
For example : to convert/change an ext2 file system to ext3 file system "tune2fs -j /dev/hdXX" replace XX with your own device name.

4.[What is FUSE?](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/fuse.html)<br>
**FUSE** is a userspace filesystem framework. It consists of a kernel module (fuse.ko), a userspace library (libfuse.*) and a mount utility 
(fusermount). One of the most important features of FUSE is allowing secure, non-privileged mounts. This opens up new possibilities for the use 
of filesystems. A good example is sshfs: a secure network filesystem using the sftp protocol.

5.[Windows File Systems](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-client/backup-and-storage/fat-hpfs-and-ntfs-file-systems)<br>
Windows file systems includes NTFS, FAT, and HPFS. This documentation of windows file systems has an overview of NTFS, FAT, and HPFS.
Their advantages and disadvantages and also their naming convention. 

6.[What is a Clustered File System?](https://www.weka.io/learn/clustered-file-system/)<br>
A clustered file system utilizes multiple physical storage servers which simultaneously mount the file system so that it can be accessed and 
managed as one single logical system. The advantage of clustered file systems is that they share available storage capacity that could be 
under-utilized on the networks if deployed as separate entities. 

7.[File Permissions in Linux](https://www.guru99.com/file-permissions.html)<br>
Ownership of Linux files are assigned to 3 types of owner. User is the owner of the file, by default the person who created a file becomes 
its owner. Hence, user is sometimes called an owner. Group, a user-group can contain multiple users. All users belonging to a group will 
have the same Linux group permissions access to the file. Other, any other user who has access to a file. Every file and directory in Linux 
system has 3 permissions defined for all the 3 types of owner. Read : open and read a file. Write : allows owner to modify the contents of file. 
Execute : to execute a program. For more information you could check the website.

8.[File System Concept (Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzUyMy7Ihk0)<br>
File system has 3 key abstractions. The first one is a file. Then the filename e.g., mylog.txt. <br> 
he last one is directory tree or folders.

9.[Linux File System Explained (Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbgzrKJvDRw)<br>
If you ever get confused where to find things in Linux and where programs get installed. This video explains what the folders are used and 
what's in the folders.

10.[What is POSIX?](https://opensource.com/article/19/7/what-posix-richard-stallman-explains)<br>
**POSIX** is a family of standards specified by the IEEE, to clarify and make uniform the application programming interfaces provided by 
Unix-like operating systems. Richard Stallman says **"open"** and **"closed"** are the wrong way to classify software. Stallman classifies
programs as freedom-respecting and freedom-trampling. Open source discourse typically encourages certain practices for the sake of practical 
advantages, not as a moral imperative.
