1. [How to Use Nano](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-use-nano-text-editor/)<br>
GNU nano is an easy to use command line text editor for Unix and Linux operating systems.
Vim and Emacs have a steep learning curve that can be intimidating to new users. So for those
who need a simple editor, there is nano. This website has tutorial on how to use nano, if you are interested you should check it out.
2. [What is a Checksum?](https://www.howtogeek.com/363735/what-is-a-checksum-and-why-should-you-care/)<br>
Checksum is a sequence of numbers and letters used to check data for errors. 
Typical algorithm used for checksums include MD5, SHA-1, SHA-2, and SHA256.
You can use checksums to check files and other data for errors that occur during transmission.
3. [Shell Scripting](https://www.shellscript.sh/)<br>
Shell scripting is an open source computer program in Unix/Linux shell. Shell scripting
is a program to write a series of commands for the shell to execute. It can be stored and
executed at anytime which reduce programming efforts
4. [GnuPG Key Pair](https://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual/c14.html)<br>
GnuPG is a tool for secure communication. This website covers the core functionality of GnuPG.
This includes keypair creation, exchanging and verifying keys, encrypting and decrypting documents,
and authenticating documents with digital signatures. If you have troubles on how to create a key pair 
you should check this out.
5. [SSH Tunneling](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/tunneling/)<br>
SSH tunneling is a method of transporting arbitrary networking data over an encrypted SSH connection.
It can be used to add encryption to legacy applications. It can also be used to implement VPNs and access
intranet services across firewalls.
6. [Linux Regular Expression](https://www.guru99.com/linux-regular-expressions.html)<br>
Linux regular expressions are special characters which help search data and matching complex patterns.
Regular expressions are shortende as 'regexp' or 'regex'. They are used in many linux programs like
grep, bash, rename, sed, awk, etc.
7. [Unix vs Linux](https://www.guru99.com/difference-unix-vs-linux.html)<br>

a clone of Unix. Linux is free to use while Unix is licensed. You could check the website if you want to know more 
about the difference.
8. [Researchers Unveil New Linux Malware Linked to Chinese Hackers](https://thehackernews.com/2021/03/researchers-unveil-new-linux-malware.html)<br>
Cybersecurity researchers on Wednestday shed light on a new sophisticated backdoor targeting Linux endpoints and servers
that's believed to be the work of Chinese nation-state actors. Additionally, the malware comes with an encrypted configuration that houses the command-and-control (C2) IP address and port, and the password it needs to authenticate to the C2 server, before establishing connection over a TCP socket.
9. [Trojan Horse](https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/Trojan-horse)<br>
In computing, a Trojan horse is a program downloaded and installed on a computer that appears harmless, but is, in fact
malicious. Typically, the trojan horse is hidden in an innocent-looking email attachment or free download. When the user
clicks on the email attachment or downloads the free program, the malware that is hidden inside is transferred to the 
user's inside to the user's computing device. Once inside, malicious code can execute whatever task the attacker designed
it to carry out.
10. [Cryptography](https://www.ssh.com/cryptography/)<br>
Cryptography is the art and science of secret writing. It is the foundation of online identity, privacy, and security.
The origin of the term 'cryptography' is a stem from two words of the Greek language - kryptos meaning secret and
graphein meaning writing. The security of this digital life owes much to cryptography, because the modern world 
relies on electronic means for creating, storing, and transferring information.
