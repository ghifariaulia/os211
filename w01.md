Real life projects generally have multiple developers working in parallel. So a version control system like Git is needed to 
ensure there are no code conflicts between the developers.

4. [Overview Of The Debian GNU/Linux System](https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/2841)<br>
Debian differs from other Linux distributions in many ways, a few of which are radical departures from the ways distributions of 
the past were assembled. The most unique aspect of Debian development as compared to other Linux distributions is the fact that 
it has been and continues to be developed openly by a group of volunteers, and that it is open to other volunteers who wish to 
join the effort.

5. [11 reasons to use the GNOME 3 desktop environment for Linux](https://opensource.com/article/17/5/reasons-gnome)<br>
GNOME is an acronym; it stands for GNU Network Object Model. The GNOME 3 desktop was designed with the goals of being simple, 
easy to access, and reliable. GNOME's popularity attests to the achievement of those goals. I personally prefer GNOME over other desktop environment like XFCE, Cinnamon, or KDE.

6. [What is Linux?](https://opensource.com/resources/linux)<br>
In many ways, Linux is similar to other operating systems you may have used before, such as Windows, macOS (formerly OS X), or 
iOS. But Linux also is different from other operating systems in many important ways. First, and perhaps most importantly, Linux 
is open source software. The code used to create Linux is free and available to the public to view, edit, and—for users with the 
appropriate skills—to contribute to.

7. [What you probably didn’t know about sudo](https://opensource.com/article/19/10/know-about-sudo)<br>

another user while providing an audit trail of the commands and their arguments.

8. [Using apt Commands in Linux](https://itsfoss.com/apt-command-guide/)<br>
APT (Advanced Package Tool) is the command line tool to interact with the packaging system in Debian-based Linux distributions.
There is already dpkg commands to manage it. But APT is a more friendly way to handle packaging. You can use it to find and 
install new packages, upgrade packages, remove the packages etc. 

9. [What is VirtualBox?](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/virtualbox-everything-the-pros-need-to-know/)<br>
VirtualBox is a GUI and command line tool that makes it possible to deploy servers, desktops, and embedded operating systems as VMs. A single 
VirtualBox host can deploy as many guest VMs as the host hardware can handle.

10. [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)<br>
Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating 
lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like 
'#' or '*'.
