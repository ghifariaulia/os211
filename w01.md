# Top 10 List of Week 01

1. [Bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell))<br>
Bash is a command processor that typically runs in a text window where the user types commands that cause actions. Bash can also
read and execute commands from a file, called a shell script. Like all Unix shells, it supports filename globbing (wildcard
matching), piping, here documents, command substitution, variables, and control structures for condition-testing and iteration.
The keywords, syntax, dynamically scoped variables and other basic features of the language are all copied from sh. Other
features (e.g., history), are copied from csh and ksh. Bash is a POSIX-compliant shell, but with a number of extensions. It was released in 1989, it has been used as the default login shell for most Linux distributions (e.g., Debian and Ubuntu.)

2. [GNU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU)<br>
GNU is an extensive collection of free software, which can be used as an operating system or can be used in parts with other 
operating systems. The use of the completed GNU tools led to the family of operating systems popularly known as Linux. Most of 
GNU is licensed under the GNU Project's own General Public License (GPL).

3. [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git)<br>
Git is software for tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively 
developing source code during software development. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, 
non-linear workflows (thousands of parallel branches running on different systems). It was created by Linus Torvald in 2005.

4. [Debian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian)<br>
Debian also known as Debian GNU/Linux, is a Linux distribution composed of free and open-source software, developed by the 
community-supported Debian Project, which was established by Ian Murdock on August 16, 1993. The first version of Debian (0.01) 
was released on September 15, 1993, and its first stable version (1.1) was released on June 17, 1996. The Debian Stable branch is 
the most popular edition for personal computers and servers. Debian is also the basis for many other distributions, most notably 
Ubuntu.

5. [GNOME](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME)<br>
GNOME is a free and open-source desktop environment for Unix-like operating systems. GNOME was 
originally an acronym for GNU Network Object Model Environment, but the acronym was dropped because it no longer reflected the 
vision of the GNOME project. GNOME 3 is the default desktop environment on many major Linux distributions including Fedora, 
Debian, Ubuntu, SUSE Linux Enterprise (exclusively), Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS, Pop!_OS, Oracle Linux, SteamOS, Tails and 
Endless OS, as well as Solaris, a major Unix operating system; and is provided as an official edition by Manjaro. The continued 
fork of the last GNOME 2 release, called MATE, is default on many Linux distros that target low usage of system resources.

6. [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux)<br>
Linux is a family of open-source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel, an operating system kernel first released 
on September 17, 1991, by Linus Torvalds. Linux is typically packaged in a Linux distribution. Distributions include the Linux 
kernel and supporting system software and libraries, many of which are provided by the GNU Project. Many Linux distributions use 
the word "Linux" in their name, but the Free Software Foundation uses the name "GNU/Linux" to emphasize the importance of GNU 
software, causing some controversy.

7. [Sudo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudo)<br>
sudo is a program for Unix-like computer operating systems that allows users to run programs with the security privileges of 
another user, by default the superuser. It originally stood for "superuser do" as the older versions of sudo were designed to run 
commands only as the superuser. However, the later versions added support for running commands not only as the superuser but also 
as other (restricted) users, and thus it is also commonly expanded as "substitute user do". Although the latter case reflects its 
current functionality more accurately, sudo is still often called "superuser do" since it is so often used for administrative 
tasks.

8. [APT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APT_(software))<br>
Advanced Package Tool, or APT, is a free-software user interface that works with core libraries to handle the installation and 
removal of software on Debian, Ubuntu, and related Linux distributions. APT simplifies the process of managing software on 
Unix-like computer systems by automating the retrieval, configuration and installation of software packages, either from 
precompiled files or by compiling source code.

9. [VirtualBox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VirtualBox)<br>
Oracle VM VirtualBox (formerly Sun VirtualBox, Sun xVM VirtualBox and Innotek VirtualBox) is a free and open-source hosted 
hypervisor for x86 virtualization, developed by Oracle Corporation. Created by Innotek, it was acquired by Sun Microsystems in 
2008, which was in turn acquired by Oracle in 2010. VirtualBox may be installed on Windows, macOS, Linux, Solaris and OpenSolaris. There are also ports to FreeBSD and Genode. It supports the creation and management of guest virtual machines running Windows, Linux, BSD, OS/2, Solaris, Haiku, and OSx86, as well as limited virtualization of macOS guests on Apple hardware. For some guest operating systems, a "Guest Additions" package of device drivers and system applications is available,which typically improves performance, especially that of graphics.

10. [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)<br>
Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. John Gruber and Aaron Swartz 
created Markdown in 2004 as a markup language that is appealing to human readers in its source code form. Markdown is widely 
used in blogging, instant messaging, online forums, collaborative software, documentation pages, and readme files.
