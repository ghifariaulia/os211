# Top 10 List of Week 08

1. [CPU Scheduling](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/cpu-scheduling)<br>
CPU scheduling is a process that allows one process to use the CPU while the execution of another process is on 
hold(in waiting state) due to unavailability of any resource like I/O etc, thereby making full use of CPU. The 
aim of CPU scheduling is to make the system efficient, fast, and fair.

2. [Types of CPU Scheduling](https://www.guru99.com/cpu-scheduling-algorithms.html)<br>
Preemptive Scheduling, the tasks are mostly assigned with their priorities. Sometimes it is important to run a 
task with a higher priority before another lower priority task, even if the lower priority task is still running. 
The lower priority task holds for some time and resumes when the higher priority task finishes its execution.
Non-Preemptive Scheduling, the CPU has been allocated to a specific process. The process that keeps the CPU busy 
will release the CPU either by switching context or terminating.

3. [First Come First Serve](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_process_scheduling_algorithms.htm)<br>
First Come First Serve is the full form of FCFS. It is the easiest and most simple CPU scheduling algorithm. In 
this type of algorithm, the process which requests the CPU gets the CPU allocation first. This scheduling method 
can be managed with a FIFO queue.

4. [Shortest Remaining Time](https://www.guru99.com/cpu-scheduling-algorithms.html)<br>
The full form of SRT is Shortest remaining time. It is also known as SJF preemptive scheduling. In this method, 
the process will be allocated to the task, which is closest to its completion. This method prevents a newer ready 
state process from holding the completion of an older process.

5. [Priority Based Scheduling](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/priority-scheduling)<br>
Priority scheduling is a method of scheduling processes based on priority. In this method, the scheduler selects 
the tasks to work as per the priority.

6. [Round-Robin Scheduling](https://www.guru99.com/round-robin-scheduling-example.html)<br>
Round robin is the oldest, simplest scheduling algorithm. The name of this algorithm comes from the round-robin 
principle, where each person gets an equal share of something in turn. It is mostly used for scheduling 
algorithms in multitasking. This algorithm method helps for starvation free execution of processes.

7. [Shortest Job First](https://www.guru99.com/shortest-job-first-sjf-scheduling.html)<br>
SJF is a full form of (Shortest job first) is a scheduling algorithm in which the process with the shortest 
execution time should be selected for execution next. This scheduling method can be preemptive or non-preemptive. 
It significantly reduces the average waiting time for other processes awaiting execution.

8. [Multilevel Queue (MLQ) CPU Scheduling](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/multilevel-queue-mlq-cpu-scheduling/)<br>
This algorithm separates the ready queue into various separate queues. In this method, processes are assigned to 
a queue based on a specific property of the process, like the process priority, size of the memory, etc.

9. [Shortest Remaining Time First](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-shortest-remaining-time-first-srtf-algorithm/)<br>
Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF) is the preemptive version of Shortest Job Next (SJN) algorithm, where the 
processor is allocated to the job closest to completion. This algorithm requires advanced concept and knowledge 
of CPU time required to process the job in an interactive system, and hence cant be implemented there. But, in a 
batch system where it is esirable to give preference to short jobs, SRT algorithm is used.

10. [Longest Remaining Time First](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/longest-remaining-time-first-lrtf-cpu-scheduling-algorithm/)<br>
This is a pre-emptive version of Longest Job First (LJF) scheduling algorithm. In this scheduling algorithm, we 
find the process with the maximum remaining time and then process it. We check for the maximum remaining time 
after some interval of time(say 1 unit each) to check if another process having more Burst Time arrived up to 
that time.
